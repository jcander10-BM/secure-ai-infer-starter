A hands-on cybersecurity portfolio project that demonstrates how to **secure an AI inference API** end-to-end â€” from data input to model output. Built with **FastAPI**, this project includes **threat modeling**, **secure coding practices**, and **static/secret scanning**.

## ðŸš€ Overview

### ðŸ§© Business Problem & Solution

#### Author & Purpose
Designed by **JAnderson** as a cybersecurity portfolio project to demonstrate secure MLOps practices. This repository is intended for employers, recruiters, and engineers who want to understand how to secure and validate AI inference pipelines in production environments.


#### Context
Organizations increasingly expose AI inference APIs to deliver predictions, classifications, or recommendations. These endpoints are often shipped without strong security measures, leaving them vulnerable to data poisoning, prompt injection, model theft, and compliance failures.

#### Problem
Security and machine learning teams often struggle to ensure that AI inference systems can make predictions safely without leaking data or being exploited through their interfaces. Many companies lack a simple, auditable reference for securing AI APIs.

#### Solution
The Secure AI Inference Pipeline project demonstrates how to secure an inference API end-to-end. It integrates authentication, input validation, and automated testing to show how development and security practices can be combined in a production-ready design.

Key features include:
- FastAPI-based inference service with API key protection
- Threat modeling and static analysis for code and dependencies
- CI/CD integration with automated Bandit and pytest runs
- Prometheus metrics for observability and traceability
- Documentation artifacts to support compliance and audits

#### Business Impact
| Challenge | How This Project Helps |
|------------|------------------------|
| Inference APIs shipped without security baselines | Provides a reusable reference architecture |
| Security and ML teams work separately | Demonstrates DevSecOps integration |
| Manual compliance reporting | Automates checks and documentation |
| Risk of data leakage or model misuse | Adds access control, logging, and monitoring |

#### Summary
This project simulates how an enterprise can deliver AI predictions safely and confidently. It serves as both a portfolio example and a teaching resource for secure MLOps practices.
